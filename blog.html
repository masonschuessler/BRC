					<h2 class="card-title">ROAD RUNNERS CLUB OF AMERICA ANNOUNCES NEW RUNNER FRIENDLY 
						COMMUNITY® DESIGNATIONS FOR 2014 (Howdy_McGee April 23, 2020)</h2>
				  <p class="card-text">ARLINGTON, Virginia – The Road Runners Club of America (RRCA) 
					  is pleased to announce the first round of Runner Friendly Community designations 
					  for 2014, which includes: Belleville, IL; Richmond, VA; Rockwall, TX; Safety 
					  Harbor, FL and Spokane, WA.<br><br>

					  These communities have shown that they meet the program’s criteria, which includes 
					  community infrastructure, community support, and local government support for running. 
					  Each community has an infrastructure that can foster physical activity in a safe 
					  environment. They have a proven track record that organizations and businesses work 
					  together to promote running as a healthy exercise and sport. With the most important 
					  criteria being, there are positive relationships between the running community and 
					  local government.<br><br>

					  The goal of the RRCA’s Runner Friendly Community program is to shine a national 
					  spotlight on communities that standout as runner-friendly and provide incentives 
					  and ideas for communities to work towards becoming runner friendly communities. 
					  Runner Friendly Communities can also increase the quality of life, improve physical 
					  activity for residents as outlined in the National Physical Activity Plan, and 
					  provide for increased economic impact for the community.<br><br>

					  <strong>Congratulations to the following RUNNER FRIENDLY COMMUNITIES:</strong><br><br>

					  Belleville, IL – Belleville is the most populated city in the Metro-East region of 
					  the St. Louis Metropolitan Area and in Southern Illinois. The city has a population 
					  of 43,765, and due to its close proximity to Scott Air Force Base, the population 
					  receives a boost from military and federal civilian personnel, defense contractors, 
					  and military retirees.<br><br>

					  Belleville has the infrastructure to support the growth in running’s popularity. 
					  It boasts a vast network of sidewalks along with running and biking trails that 
					  make it easy for a runner to run safely in the community. The Richland Creek 
					  Greenway Trail is a 2-mile, multi-purpose, pathway meandering through the heart 
					  of Belleville. The trail is accessible at several park locations and also 
					  connects to the 6-mile MetroLink trail, which runs to the local community college. 
					  Belleville also boasts 125-miles in sidewalks for running use. The longest 
					  stretch of sidewalk is a 10-mile run down beautiful Main Street. The city has 
					  plans to extend their trail network as well.<br><br>

					  The Belleville Running Club (BRC) is an important pillar of the running community. 
					  In addition to their regular weekly group runs, BRC has been involved in the 
					  Belleville Chili Cook-off, enters teams in the annual River to River Relay, and 
					  are active in the city’s adopt a trail program. BRC hosts an annual Couch to 5K 
					  training program to prepare new runners for their first 5K at the local Law Day 
					  Run. “Our community recognizes the benefits of actively promoting physical fitness, 
					  including running as part of a healthy lifestyle,” commented Mark W. Eckert, 
					  Mayor of the City of Belleville. “The City of Belleville has a strong record of 
					  support for the local running community and we are dedicated to growing a healthy 
					  society.”<br><br>

					  Community leaders who provided support and letters of recommendation include 
					  Toby Trapp, President of Belleville Running Club; Mark Eckert, Mayor of Belleville; 
					  Andria Powell, Owner of Circa; Susan Ivy, Office Manager, Chiro-Med; Anne Thomure, 
					  Director of Hospital and Community Relations, Memorial Hospital; Jim Schneider, 
					  Director of Community Development for the City of Belleville.<br><br>

					  Richmond, VA – Richmond demonstrates how collaboration and partnerships can help to 
					  make a community runner friendly. As the Capital of Virginia, the Metro Richmond Area 
					  is home to over 1.2 million residents. In the Richmond area, there are a variety of 
					  trails, parks, and pedestrian networks in the city and surrounding counties that are 
					  used year-round by runners and walkers. The Virginia Capital Trail, which will eventually 
					  link Williamsburg and Richmond, is in the final stages of completion and offers miles of 
					  trails for runners, walkers, and bikers.<br><br>

					  There are a variety of runner-friendly businesses located throughout the community. 
					  Specialty stores such as Roadrunner Running Store, Endorphin Fitness, Lucky Foot 
					  and 3 Sports cater to runners and host daily and weekly group runs starting and 
					  ending at their respective locations. Bon Secours Richmond Health System and HCA 
					  Virginia Health System are also dedicated to serving runners and helping them stay 
					  fit and healthy. Fitness centers such as the YMCA, American Family Fitness, and 
					  ACAC work closely with runners on a daily basis and also sponsor some of the 
					  biggest running events in Richmond. Coffee shops and restaurants, such as Crossroads 
					  Coffee & Ice Cream, Starbucks on Grove Avenue, and Hardywood Park Brewery, often 
					  serve as pre- and post-run meeting spots and are safe places for runners to get 
					  out of bad weather or fill a water bottle during a run. Ukrop’s Homestyle Foods 
					  and Martin’s Food Markets also support and sponsor events as well as offer healthy 
					  eating and nutrition clinics for runners.<br><br>

					  The RRCA member Metropolitan Richmond Sports Backers works closely with the Richmond 
					  Road Runners Club (RRRC), and other organizations such as schools, local governments, 
					  and other nonprofit organizations to promote running. Both organizations are active in 
					  supporting local youth running programs by hosting and providing grants to programs 
					  including Kids Run RVA. The Sports Backers and RRRC also have a strong relationship 
					  with local media. There is in-depth coverage of running events in the daily newspaper 
					  and on local television stations, as well as a number of websites and print outlets 
					  committed to coverage of the local running scene.<br><br>

					  Richmond hosts numerous running events every year, including the Anthem Richmond 
					  Marathon, American Family Fitness Half Marathon, and Ukrop’s Monument Avenue 10k. 
					  Collectively these events attract thousands and thousands of runners and are great 
					  community celebrations of running and fitness. The events bring together the support 
					  of the Sports Backers, Richmond Road Runners Club, local governments, area 
					  businesses, as well as clubs, teams, and individuals. They serve as shining examples 
					  of the broad community support available for running in Richmond.<br><br>

					  “Richmond is an ideal candidate for the recognition as a Runner Friendly Community, 
					  and I unequivocally and wholeheartedly support this nomination,” commented Cynthia 
					  Newbille, Richmond City Council Member. “Running is an integral part of our community 
					  that has helped our residents lead healthy, happy lifestyles.”<br><br>

					  Community leaders who provided support and letters of recommendation include Cynthia 
					  I. Newbille, Richmond City Council member; Ned W. Massee, Vice President, MeadWestvaco; 
					  Jon Lugbill, Executive Director, Metropolitan Richmond Sports Backers.<br><br>

					  Rockwall, TX – Home to the RRCA member Rockwall Running Club, Rockwall hosts over 
					  twenty-five running and triathlon events annually and is home to the US Toyota 
					  Triathlon Championships and the Patriot Half Marathon. While Rockwall is considered 
					  part of the larger Dallas/Fort Worth Metroplex, it is a community of 38,000 residents 
					  with a dedicated running community. Emerald Bay Park opened in Rockwall in January 
					  2008 and is highlighted by a lighted aerial fountain in the middle of the pond, which 
					  is surround by a walking and running trail.<br><br>

					  Last year over 8,000 residents participated in running events in Rockwall. The passion 
					  for running is evident in the local businesses that have donated hundreds of thousands 
					  of dollars to support running events in recent years. The popularity of running in the 
					  community has also been reflected in the tremendous growth of the Rockwall Running Club, 
					  from just five members in 2009 to two hundred members today. During the same time, the 
					  number of road races the club hosts has grown from one to twenty-five, including the only 
					  half marathon in the Dallas/Fort Worth market in the month of May. Youth running clubs 
					  are supported at five of the eleven elementary schools in the area, and there are three 
					  summer track programs for youth.<br><br>

					  To support local races, the local government reviews safety procedures for all events, 
					  provides free traffic cones, and community patrols provide logistical support. Rockwall 
					  print and broadcast media regularly make an effort to promote and cover all events.<br><br>

					  “To say Rockwall is a Runner Friendly Community is an understatement,” commented Casey 
					  Allen, City of Rockwall Parks & Recreation Manager. “From the first time you visit and 
					  take a run with us, you’re a member of our running family. It doesn’t matter if your 5 
					  years old or 80 years old, there is someone to run with.”<br><br>

					  Community leaders who provided support and letters of recommendation include Billy 
					  Self of the Texas Novachem Corporation; Gregg MacInnis of Cherry Financial Partners; 
					  Case Allison, City Parks and Recreation Manager; Ruthie Cole of the Rockwall Running 
					  Club.<br><br>

					  Safety Harbor, FL – With year-round, favorable weather along with safe, well 
					  maintained, sidewalks and streets, Safety Harbor is in many ways the ideal community 
					  for a runner to call home. The harbor or bay of the same name on which Safety Harbor 
					  is located is the nearly landlocked far northwestern extension of Tampa Bay and is 
					  located on the west side of that bay. The city has a population nearly 17,000 residents 
					  and is home to several running clubs, including the RRCA member West Florida Y 
					  Running Club.<br><br>

					  Safety Harbor is home to the Bayshore Linear Greenway Recreational Trail that was 
					  developed in 1998 to provide a measured recreational path for walkers, joggers, 
					  and cyclists. The trail begins at the Marina fountain and includes distance markers, 
					  scenic views of Old Tampa Bay, and water fountains near benches.The trail connects 
					  to the Ream Wilson trail to the south and it connects to Phillipe Park, a shady 
					  county park to the north. There is an extensive network of sidewalks in the 
					  community as well. The city has recently added three flashing crosswalks to provide 
					  for safer street crossings.<br><br>

					  The local importance of running and fitness is demonstrated in Safety Harbor 
					  becoming a Let’s Move City that is dedicated to solving the problem of childhood 
					  obesity. Local officials and city recreation staff developed goals to promote the 
					  health of residents to earn the designation. The city has youth running programs 
					  that operate annually including the Healthy Strides, Speed & Agility, and Track 
					  program. They also host running related summer camps.<br><br>

					  The Safety Harbor business community is supportive of local runners. Lola’s 
					  Running specialty store provides water stops along the Bayshore trail for runners. 
					  Nolan’s Pub along with the Safety Harbor Resort & Spa has sponsored events. 
					  Additionally, Fit Life Foods often donates healthy snacks for races.<br><br>

					  “Not only does Safety Harbor have beautiful, safe places to run, it is a 
					  community of runners,” noted Lisa Kothe, Library Director for Safety Harbor 
					  Public Library. “Any time of the day, even in the heat of a Florida summer, 
					  runners can be spotted along Bayshore Boulevard.”<br><br>

					  Community leaders who provided support and letters of recommendation 
					  include: Lisa Kothe, Safety Harbor Library Director; Nick Zivolich, 
					  CEO Best Damn Race; Craige Davide, Owner Nolan’s Pub; Fred Rzymek, 
					  Owner, Design Sports.<br><br>

					  Spokane, WA – The City of Spokane is located on the Spokane River 
					  in Eastern Washington and is 92 miles south of the Canadian border. 
					  With a population of 208,916, Spokane is the second largest city in 
					  the State of Washington. The Spokane area offers an abundance of 
					  outdoor activities that can be enjoyed in outlying natural areas that 
					  cater to runners.<br><br>

					  In 1907, Spokane’s board of park commissioners retained the services 
					  of the Olmsted Brothers to draw up a plan for Spokane’s parks. Today, 
					  Spokane has a system of over 87 parks totaling 4,100 acres. Riverfront 
					  Park, created after Expo ‘74, is 100 acres in downtown Spokane, and the 
					  site of some of Spokane’s largest events including the Lilac Bloomsday 
					  Run Post Race Celebration. The park is a popular site for runners that 
					  includes the The Joy of Running Together sculpture by David Govedare 
					  installed in 1984. This steel sculpture depicts runners of all kinds 
					  and celebrates the Spokane tradition of Bloomsday.<br><br>

					  A more active way to see natural sites in the Spokane area includes 
					  travelling the Spokane River Centennial Trail, which features over 
					  37 miles of paved trails running along the Spokane River from Sontag 
					  Park in west Spokane to the east shore of Lake Coeur d’Alene in 
					  Coeur d’Alene, Idaho. This trail continues on for 24 miles as 
					  the North Idaho Centennial Trail in Idaho.<br><br>

					  Each May, Spokane plays host to the Lilac Bloomsday Run, one of 
					  the largest road races in the country, regularly attracting 50,000 
					  participants annually. In 2014, the race will serve as the RRCA’s 
					  National 12 K Championship. The RRCA member Bloomsday Road Runners 
					  Club (BRRC) was founded by the Bloomsday Run and has developed into 
					  a solid group of running enthusiasts devoted to the promotion of a 
					  variety of running events in Spokane. The BRRC will host the 56th 
					  Annual RRCA National Convention May 1-4, 2014.<br><br>

					  Local businesses are very supportive of the Spokane running community. 
					  The local Starbucks allows runners to use their bathrooms and they 
					  provide ice water to runners as needed. The local club has been working 
					  with the regional Starbucks manager to encourage their corporate headquarters 
					  to work with the RRCA to designate all stores as Runner Friendly Businesses. 
					  Locally, Starbucks has donated coffee and tea at many local running events. 
					  The local running store, Runner’s Soul, allows use of their facilities to 
					  runners in need while out on the run.<br><br>

					  “The City of Spokane, and the Spokane Fire Department (SFD) in particular, 
					  has been involved in community healthy living initiatives for over 40 years,” 
					  comment Brian Schaeffer, assistant fire chief of the City of Spokane. 
					  “Spokane’s mantra is ‘Near Nature, Near Perfect’ and our commitment to the 
					  healthy outdoor lifestyle is reflected daily throughout our community’s miles 
					  of trails, roads and formal races. I am extremely proud to be a part of our 
					  community, and am humbled that Spokane is being considered for the RRCA 
					  recognition.”<br><br>

					  Community leaders who provided support and letters of recommendation include: 
					  Brian Schaeffer, Assistant Fire Chief; Sergeant JD Anderson, Special Events Unit 
					  Supervisor, City of Spokane Police Department; Christopher Guidotti, Park Manager, 
					  Riverside State Park; Christopher Morlan, Architect and A1A Head Coach; Nate 
					  Kinghorn, Runners Soul Spokane.<br><br>
